This packages provides the TYPO3 CMS Extension `EXT:monitoring` which extends the CMS with a monitoring system that
gives an insight into the health state of custom TYPO3 components through an API endpoint and a CLI command, e.g. for
post-deployment checks.

> [!WARNING]
> This package is still in early development and must be considered unfit for production use. Bear with me.
> We'll get there.

## üöÄ Features

- [Extensible monitoring system](Documentation/architecture.md) with automatic service discovery (using DI) for custom
  authorization and monitoring checks.
- Built-in **SelfCareProvider** for meta-level monitoring of the monitoring system itself
- Supports caching for expensive monitoring operations
- Delivers health reports in three ways:
  - **JSON response**: Returns structured responses for the overall health status
  - **CLI command**: Command-line interface for running monitoring checks
  - **Backend Module**: TYPO3 backend module


## üî• Quick Start

### Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require mteu/typo3-monitoring
```

### Configuration

1. Configure the extension in the TYPO3 backend:
   - Go to **Admin Tools ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Extension Configuration**
   - Select `monitoring`
   - Set the monitoring endpoint path (default: `/monitor/health`)
   - Configure authorizer settings for token-based and admin user authentication

2. Or better yet configure the settings programmatically:
    ```php
    # config/system/settings.php

    <?php

    return [
        // ..
        'EXTENSIONS' => [
            'monitoring' => [
                'api' => [
                    'endpoint' => '/monitor/health',
                ],
                'authorizer' => [
                    'mteu\Monitoring\Authorization\TokenAuthorizer' => [
                        'enabled' => true,
                        'secret' => 'your-secure-secret',
                        'authHeaderName' => 'X-TYPO3-MONITORING-AUTH',
                        'priority' => 10,
                    ],
                    'mteu\Monitoring\Authorization\AdminUserAuthorizer' => [
                        'enabled' => true,
                        'priority' => -10,
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
        // ..
   ];
    ```

3. Access your monitoring endpoint while authenticated as backend user with the role of Admin or System Maintainer:
   ```
   https://<your-site>/monitor/health
   ```

### Authentication

This extension ships two authentication methods natively:

#### Admin User Authentication
Access the endpoint while logged in as a TYPO3 backend administrator.

#### Token-based Authentication
Add the configured auth header (default: `X-TYPO3-MONITORING-AUTH`) with an HMAC signature:

```bash
curl -s -H "X-TYPO3-MONITORING-AUTH: <auth-token>" \
     https://<your-site>/monitor/health | jq '.'
```

**Token Generation:**
The HMAC token is generated using TYPO3's HashService with the endpoint path and your configured secret:

```php
$hashService = \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance(\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Crypto\HashService::class);
$token = $hashService->hmac('/monitor/health', 'your-secure-secret');
```

## üìù Response Format

The monitoring endpoint returns JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "isHealthy": true,
  "services": {
    "service_one": "healthy",
    "service_two": "healthy",
    "service_three": "healthy"
  }
}
```

- `isHealthy`: Overall health status (boolean)
- `services`: Object with individual service statuses ("healthy" or "unhealthy")

HTTP status codes:
- `200` All services healthy
- `401` Unauthorized access
- `403` Unsupported protocol
- `503` One or more services unhealthy

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

### Creating Custom Providers

Implement the `MonitoringProvider` interface:

```php
<?php

use mteu\Monitoring\Provider\MonitoringProvider;
use mteu\Monitoring\Result\MonitoringResult;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Attribute\AutoconfigureTag;

#[AutoconfigureTag(tag: 'monitoring.provider')]
final class MyMonitoringProvider implements MonitoringProvider
{
    public function getName(): string
    {
        return 'MyService';
    }

    public function getDescription(): string
    {
        return 'Monitors my custom service';
    }

    public function isActive(): bool
    {
        return true;
    }

    public function execute(): MonitoringResult
    {
        // Your monitoring logic here
        return new MonitoringResult(
            $this->getName(),
            true,
        );
    }
}
```

### Creating Custom Authorizers

Implement the `Authorizer` interface:

```php
<?php

use mteu\Monitoring\Authorization\Authorizer;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Attribute\AutoconfigureTag;

#[AutoconfigureTag(tag: 'monitoring.authorizer')]
final class MyAuthorizer implements Authorizer
{
    public function isAuthorized(ServerRequestInterface $request): bool
    {
        // Your authorization logic here
        return true;
    }

    public function getPriority(): int
    {
        return 100; // Higher priority = checked first
    }
}
```
